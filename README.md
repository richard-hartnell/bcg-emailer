A tiny personal assistant script. If you run it on a Sunday it gives a seven-day warning for the following week's meeting. If you run it on a Thursday it gives the second reminder. Tada!

Currently working on getting it to run constantly on a Raspberry Pi.

All the l/ps are stored in local text files.

TO INSTALL REQUIREMENTS ON CLI:

pip install google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib
